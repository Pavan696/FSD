	<p>With Artificial Intelligence (AI), block chain and Internet of Things (IoT) changing the world around, the judiciary is bound to evolve dramatically by 2030. And so will be the demand of service from lawyers. With all the information and technological support at hand, the client will already have the data analysis and insights.

Hence the future lawyers need to be super lawyers who will be analyst, broadcaster and lawyer, all rolled into one.[16]</p>
